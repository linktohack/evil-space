vim-space for evil-mode

`evil-space` is intend to be a ported version of `vim-space` for `evil-mode`
with some enhancement features such as remember count motions, e.g.
    9j SPC SPC SPC

`evil-space` is usable by source the file directly but not a complete minor
mode.

Pull requests are very welcome as I'm new to `Emacs` world and still don't
know what coding convention to follow to write a mode.
